# Creating of group accounts

The TRP system allows the creation of groups that include both registered and unregistered carrier accounts. This flexibility ensures that all relevant carriers, regardless of their registration status, can be included in the tendering process.

**Creating Groups with Unregistered Accounts**

When creating a group, users can include email addresses of carriers that may not yet have accounts registered in the system. The system will automatically handle the registration of these unregistered accounts when a tender is launched.

**Notification and Onboarding Process**

Once the system creates new accounts for unregistered carriers, it initiates an onboarding process to ensure they are prepared to participate in the tender:

1. Notification Email: The system sends an automatic notification email to each unregistered carrier's provided email address. This email contains instructions on how to activate their account, including a unique link to set a password and log in to the TRP system (see Appendix 1).
2. Account Activation: Carriers must follow the link in the notification email to set their password and complete the registration process. After logging in, they gain access to the tender details and can begin reviewing the rate card and preparing their quotes.

**Permissions**

The created account has the “Participant” level of permissions. See Permissions <mark style="color:red;">(TODO insert link)</mark> for a detailed description.
