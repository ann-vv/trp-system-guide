# Groups(and Scopes)

## Overview

In the TRP system, Groups and Scopes are essential configuration elements that determine how carriers participate in freight tenders.

They define the services provided by different carriers and how these carriers are represented in the tender rate card's coverage statistics.

## Groups

Groups in the TRP system are collections of entities that can include external carriers, internal carriers, and internal shippers. They are used to organize carriers and other entities for streamlined communication and management during the tender process.

Each group is defined by two key parameters:

* **Name**: The name identifier for the group.
* **Email List**: A list of email addresses for the persons within the group.

You need to configure scopes to define the participation of groups in the tender. For more information please refer to [Scopes](scopes.md).
