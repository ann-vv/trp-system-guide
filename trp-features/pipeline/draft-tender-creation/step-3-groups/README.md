# Step 3: Groups

### Overview

The **Groups** tab within a draft tender plays an important role in managing and organizing the groups that will participate in the tender and cover the rate card. This tab is designed to provide the user with comprehensive control over group creation, participation, and rate card coverage allocation.

### **Actions in the Groups Tab**

At the top of the **Groups** tab, you will find two actions:

1. **Update Groups**:\
   This action refreshes the groups participating in the tender. If there have been any changes to the scopes or group settings, using this action ensures that the rate card coverage is updated accordingly. This feature is essential for keeping the tender data synchronized with recent configuration changes.\
   Additionally, updating the groups can also be done during the process of saving scope settings. For more detailed information on how to save and update scopes, refer to the [**Scopes**](../../../settings/groups-and-scopes/scopes.md) configuration section.
2. **Create Group**:\
   The **Create group** action allows users to create a new group directly within the tender, providing more flexibility during the tender's preparation phase. Creating groups within the tender is a powerful tool for tailoring group involvement specific to that tender, without affecting the general group settings of the system. For step-by-step guidance on creating groups, refer to the **Group Creation** section.

### **Sections in the Groups Tab**

The **Groups** tab is divided into two primary sections:

1.  **Participants**:\
    The **Participants** section contains individual **info cards** for each group, summarizing key data about the group’s involvement in the tender. Each card displays the group name, email accounts, and the percentage of the rate card that the group covers.

    By clicking on any group’s card, the system will display a **right-side drawer** with detailed information about the group, including:

    * **Group Configuration in Scopes**: Displays how the group is configured to cover various transport modes, origins, destinations, and service types within the rate card.
    * **Activate/Deactivate Group**: Provides the ability to activate or deactivate the group’s participation in the tender. This can be useful if you need to temporarily suspend or re-enable a group’s involvement without permanently deleting the group. For more information on group activation and deactivation, refer to the **Group Participation Management** section of the documentation.

2. **Rate Card Coverage**:\
   This section provides a clear overview of how the participating groups cover the various lanes of the rate card. Clicking on the info card(s) in this section opens the rate card, allowing for manual group allocation. This feature enables you to assign or adjust the coverage of groups based on lane-specific requirements. For detailed guidance on manually allocating groups to lanes, refer to the [**Manual group allocation in the rate card**](manual-group-allocation-in-the-rate-card.md) section.
