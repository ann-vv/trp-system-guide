# Step 2: Rate card(s)

In this step, you will upload and configure rate cards that are essential for the tender. The TRP system allows multiple rate cards per tender, providing flexibility in managing various lanes, services, and cost structures.

### **Initiating Rate Card Upload**

To begin, click the **"Create First Rate Card"** button if no rate card has been added yet, or simply press the **"+ Rate Card"** button to add more rate cards to the tender. This will open a configuration panel where you can set up the initial parameters for the rate card.

### **Rate Card Configuration Panel**

In the popup panel, you will need to configure the following initial parameters:

* **Transport Mode**:\
  Select the available transport mode for the rate card. This ensures that the rate card is aligned with the mode of transport required for the tender.
* **Rate Card Title**:\
  Enter a descriptive title for the rate card. This title will help distinguish between different rate cards in tenders with multiple configurations.
* **Baseline File Upload**:\
  Upload the baseline rate card file. This file typically contains pre-set pricing data and lane configurations that will be used as a basis for the tender’s bidding process. For more details jump to [Reviewing and Mapping Rate Card Fields](step-2-rate-card-s.md#reviewing-and-mapping-rate-card-fields).
* **Bid Rules Configuration**:\
  Set up bid rules that determine how lanes with errors will be handled during the rate card upload process. The system offers the following options:
  * **Save Valid**:\
    Only valid rows in the rate card will be saved, ignoring any cells with errors.
  * **Reject Lane**:\
    If any data in a lane contains errors, the entire lane will not be saved.
* **Additional Options**:\
  There are three additional checkboxes that further configure how the system handles the rate card upload: blanks overriding, off-scope, and baseline grouping. Hover over the **info icon** next to each checkbox to view detailed explanations of these configurations.

### **Reviewing and Mapping Rate Card Fields**

Once you have uploaded the baseline file, the system will present a popup that enables you to review the field mappings. This step is crucial to ensure that the data in the rate card aligns with the system’s expected fields.

* **Field Mapping**:\
  The system automatically attempts to map the fields in your uploaded rate card to the predefined fields in the system. Review these mappings carefully, and make any necessary adjustments to ensure accurate data alignment. For detailed instructions on how to use the field mapping feature, refer to the **Field Mapping Guide** \[link to page].
* **Confirm and Proceed**:\
  Once you have confirmed the mappings, click **Proceed** to proceed with the rate card configuration.

**Step 7.3: Finalizing Rate Card Setup**

After the field mapping is complete, the system will display the uploaded rate card. From this view, you can review, edit, and take further actions on the rate card.\
If any corrections are needed, you can modify the rate card directly in the system. For more information on editing rate cards, refer to the **Rate Card Guide** <mark style="color:red;">\[link to page]</mark>.
