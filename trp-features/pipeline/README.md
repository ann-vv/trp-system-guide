# Pipeline

The **Pipeline** is a dynamic board within the TRP system that visually represents the full lifecycle of each tender, guiding users through every stage from creation to completion. It provides a clear, organized view of tender statuses, offering users an intuitive way to monitor and manage tenders as they progress. Each tender moves through predefined statuses, ensuring a structured and transparent process for all participants.

**Tender Statuses in the Pipeline**

1.  **Draft**

    It is the initial stage of the tender lifecycle. At this point, the tender is being [created](tender-creation/), and the basic information is being compiled, such as tender name, deadlines, currency, and rate card configuration. Users can modify and edit all relevant details during this phase, including setting up carrier groups and defining scopes. The tender remains in the draft stage until all critical data is input and the tender is ready for publication.
2.  **Port Validation**

    Used for tenders where interim actions are required, often related to port-specific logistics. Carriers may need to make modifications or provide additional details for specific ports. This could involve actions like changing the port of entry, paying fees for port stays, or securing necessary licenses and permits to enter the port. During this phase, tenders await completion of these requirements before moving forward in the process.
3.  **Open**

    This status indicates that the tender has been published and is now available for carriers to submit their bids (also referred to as quoting). Carriers receive notifications about the tender and can begin evaluating and responding with their rate proposals for each lane listed in the rate card. This stage is critical for gathering competitive quotes and ensuring all qualified carriers can participate. The tender remains open until the specified deadline or until it is manually closed.
4.  **Closed**

    The tender is no longer open for carrier participation. This can occur automatically when the tenderâ€™s expiration date is reached, or it can be triggered manually by the tender owner. Once in this status, carriers can no longer submit quotes, and the tender is locked for further modifications. At this stage, the tender owner reviews all received bids and prepares for the selection of winning carriers.
5.  **Submitted**

    This status reflects that all pre-agreements between the tender owner and participating carriers have been established. In this phase, the tender owner begins awarding carriers based on their bids, lane coverage, and service quality. Additional columns in the rate card, such as lane status (won, partial, lost, NA), awarded volume percentages, and lane status comments, are updated to reflect the outcome of the tender. Although submitted, the tender can still be moved to the **Closed** status if necessary for further adjustments.
6.  **Completed**

    Represents the final stage of the tender lifecycle. At this point, all agreements between the shipper and the selected carriers have been finalized. Carriers are officially awarded the tender, and the necessary legal and operational documents have been prepared, signed, and uploaded into the system. Once a tender reaches this status, all arrangements for the freight shipment are in place, and the tender is considered successfully concluded.
