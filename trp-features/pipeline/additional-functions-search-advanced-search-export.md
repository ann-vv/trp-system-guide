### Quick Search

The **Quick Search** function provides a fast, dynamic way to filter the **Pipeline Board**. There is a simple search bar where users can enter either the **tender title** or its **unique number**. As you type, the system automatically filters and displays only the tenders whose title or number includes the entered keyword. This feature allows for rapid identification of tenders without needing to apply advanced search filters, significantly speeding up navigation and tender management.

### **Find Tenders**

The **Find Tenders** feature, located at the top of the page, allows users to quickly search for tenders using various criteria. The search bar can filter tenders by:

* **Query**: Full or partial tender **title**; or number. Case-insensitive
* **Customers**
* **Industries**
* **Tags**
* **Transport Modes**
* **Costs**
* **Groups**
* **External(Customer) and Launched Deadlines**: Track based on internal company deadlines or customer deadlines.
* &#x20;Additionally, you can include **archived** and **canceled** tenders in the search results if needed.
* **Criteria Conjunction.** An important parameter within the **Find Tenders** functionality. You can configure how the criteria interact (OR, AND modes) which gives you greater flexibility depending on how broad or narrow your search requirements are:
  * **OR**: Returns tenders that meet **any** of the specified criteria.
  * **AND**: Returns tenders that meet **all** the specified criteria.

### Export

#### **Export Rates**

You can export rates for tenders that are in the **open**, **closed**, **submitted**, or **completed** statuses only. When selecting the **Export -> Rates** option, a configuration panel will appear on the right, where you can set specific export parameters:

1. **Profiles and dates:** transport mode and deadline dates.
2. **Tenders**: Select the specific tenders from which you want to export rate card data. Use the handy **quick search** function and one-click **select/deselect al**l to streamline your process.
3. **Select costs**. Quick search and one-click **select/deselect al**l functions are also available.
4. **Fields**: Choose the fields of the rates (e.g., price per unit, currency) to be included in the exported file. Quick search and one-click **select/deselect al**l functions are also available.

This level of customization ensures that you export exactly the data needed for your analysis.

#### **Export Tenders List**

This function allows you to export a list of tenders from the **Pipeline** page without the need for additional filtering. All tenders—regardless of status—will be included in the export.

The exported file contains the following columns:

* **Title**: Tender title.
* **Number**: Unique tender number.
