**Permissions**

Access to detailed progress information varies based on the logged-in user’s role and permissions within the system. For instance, a **Support-User** or **Tender Manager** may have full visibility into carrier quotes and tender progress, while other users have restricted access.

### **Carrier Quoting Activity**

* **Quotes Submission**: Carriers can view the tender and submit their quotes based on the lanes and services listed in the rate card.
* **Quote Completion Percentage**: The system shows the percentage of completion for carrier quotes, indicating how much of the rate card has been filled with cost data from carriers. This allows users to monitor quoting progress and identify any gaps that may need attention.
