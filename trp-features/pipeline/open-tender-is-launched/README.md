# Open - Tender is Launched

Once a tender is launched in the TRP system, users can access key information and manage the tenderâ€™s lifecycle through the **Tender Dashboard**. This dashboard provides three main sections that reflect the status of the tender: **Tender Details**, **Progress**, and **Communication**. The information and functionality displayed depend on the logged-in user's permissions.
