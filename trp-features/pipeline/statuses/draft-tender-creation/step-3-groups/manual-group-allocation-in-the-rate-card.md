# Manual group allocation in the rate card

### **Configuring Group Coverage in the Rate Card**

1. Select the rate card in the **Rate Card Coverage** area.

2. **Allocating groups to lanes.** The system will guide you through the process with on-screen hints:

* **Select the lane(s)** in the rate card that you want to allocate the group to.
* **Press "Allocate Group(s)".**

3. **Assign to freight type** (origin, main, or/and destination).

The system supports the manual allocation of both the created groups inside the tender and groups that were previously set up in the general system settings.

4. **System response**:\
   Once the group has been allocated to the relevant lanes, the system will automatically update the percentage of rate card coverage by this group. This ensures the newly created group is actively participating in the tender process.

### **Cancel Manual Allocations**

If needed, you can revert manual allocations by pressing the **"Discard Manual Allocations"** button. This will remove the group's association with the selected lanes, and the system will recalculate the rate card coverage percentage accordingly.

### **Impact on Tender Lifecycle**

Once the tender is launched and moves to the **Open** status, the system will enable lane quoting for manually allocated groups. These groups will be able to submit quotes for the lanes they have been assigned to, and their contributions will be reflected in the tender's evaluation process.
