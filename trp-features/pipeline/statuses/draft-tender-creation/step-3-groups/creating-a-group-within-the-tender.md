# Creating a group within the tender

In addition to the general configuration of groups and scopes in the system settings, the TRP system offers the flexibility to manually create and allocate groups within a specific tender. This feature provides more control over how carriers are assigned to lanes in the rate card.

{% hint style="info" %}
These functions are available while the tender is in the [**Draft**](../) status.
{% endhint %}

### **Steps to create a group within the tender**

1. **Initiating Group Creation**:\
   To manually create a group within the tender, click the **"Create group"** button. A popup window will appear, displaying the same group creation functionality as found in the [Groups](../../../../settings/groups-and-scopes/groups.md) system settings.
2. **Entering Group Details**:
   * **Title**:\
     Enter a descriptive name for the group.
   * **Emails**:\
     Add a list of email addresses for the carriers or participants in this group. The system will [create accounts](../../../../settings/groups-and-scopes/creating-of-group-accounts.md) for these email addresses if they do not already exist.

3. Save the group upon the **Proceed** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once the group is created, it will initially have **0% coverage** in the rate card. This is because the group created within the tender cannot be set up in Scopes, and has not yet been assigned to any lane or scope within the tender.
