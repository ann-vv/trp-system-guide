# Open - Tender is Launched

Once a tender is launched in the TRP system, users can access key information and manage the tenderâ€™s rate card completion and other details upon selecting the tender in the [Pipeline](../../) and viewing the tender details page. This page provides three main sections that reflect the status of the tender: **Tender Details**, **Progress**, and **Communication**. The information and functionality displayed depend on the logged-in user's permissions. <mark style="color:red;">TODO</mark> permissions section separately
